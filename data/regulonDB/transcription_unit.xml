		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>The <i>bglGFB</i> operon codes for one of four &beta;-glucoside utilization systems in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [12081976]|.  It codes for the autoregulatory antiterminator BglG, the EII glucoside transporter BglF, and the glucosidase BglB |CITS: [3034860]|.  This operon is silent in wild-type cells grown in the lab due to the transcriptional regulator HNS |CITS: [1452042]|, but it can be activated by insertion of an IS element upstream of the operon, as well as by point mutations within the CRP-binding site or within <i>gyrA</i> or <i>gyrB</i> |CITS: [1311089][6270569][3025456]|. <br>Once the operon is released from its silent state, it can be activated by Crp and repressed by Fis |CITS: [10792463][10760165]|.  The <i>bgl</i> promoter is controlled by &sigma;<sup>S</sup>, whose effect is mediated by Crl |CITS: [12081976][12177351]|.  Once silencing ceases, <i>bglGFB</i> expression is controlled by the aromatic &beta;-glucosides salicin and arbutin via an mRNA antitermination mechanism |CITS: [2846278]|.  BglG is activated by phosphorylation by HPr (or FPr) but is inactivated by additional phosphorylation by BglF at a different site |CITS: [10369677]|.  BglG is both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated by BglF, the enzyme II component of the Bgl sugar-transporting phosphotransferase system.  The phosphorylation state of BglG at the BglF site is controlled by one of the &beta;-glucoside inducers.  In the absence of &beta;-glucoside, BglG associates with and is phosphorylated by BglF in the cytoplasmic membrane.  Addition of the inducer leads to dephosphorylation of BglG at the BglF site, and its localization to the cytoplasm where it forms homodimers and its transcriptional antitermination activity allows transcription of the <i>bgl</i> operon.  The doubly phosphorylated form of BglG is unable to dimerize and bind to the target mRNA and does not have antiterminator activity |CITS: [1382312][2195546][2200123][2673534][12771379][15769463]|. <br>In the absence of the activated BglG homodimer, transcription from the <i>bgl</i> promoter is terminated at one of two rho-independent terminators.  The first is located in the leader region of the <i>bgl</i> mRNA at a site immediately upstream of the <i>bglG</i> translation start site, and the second lies between <i>bglG</i> and <i>bglF</i> |CITS: [3034860][3301003][2846278]|.  BglG is able to bind to a site in the <i>bgl</i> mRNA which partially overlaps the rho-independent terminators, possibly blocking the formation of the terminator secondary structure and allowing transcription |CITS: [1698125]|.  BlgG binding stabilizes the 5' end of the <i>bgl</i> mRNA |CITS: [11426055]|.  BglG also binds the &beta;-subunit of RNA polymerase |CITS: [10200263]|. <br>In addition to these well-established forms of transcriptional regulation, the <i>bgl</i> operon expression is also affected by StpA, Hfq, LeO, and BglJ, but their specific mechanisms remain to be determined |CITS: [9473058][7984093][9422614][8725214]|. <br>Repression of the <i>bglGFB</i> operon by StpA occurs only in the presence of the N-terminal H-NS protein domain, which comprises the core for dimerization |CITS: [18245262]|.<br>The mRNA produced by  the  <i>bglGFB</i> operon has been observed mainly in the cellular membrane |CITS: [31540875]|.</TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>

Negative regulation occurs when the <i>lac</i> repressor (LacI) binds to the operator, preventing transcription by RNA polymerase |CITS: [6259624][2166165]|.

Synthesis of the <i>lac</i> operon proteins is induced when <i>E. coli</i> is grown on lactose in the absence of glucose. CRP is the principal activator of the <i>lac</i> operon.

In this repression system, LacI binds to two operators centered at positions 10 bp (O1) and -82 bp (O3), and formation of the repressor loop is critical |CITS: [8984648][ 8984647][14725772][2166165]|. Expression of p1 is also stimulated when LacI binds to O1 |CITS: [2166165]|. <br>Induction occurs when the physiological inducer, allolactose, binds to the <i>lac</i> repressor, preventing it from binding to the operator |CITS: [2166165][15950160]|. Nonphysiological analogs, such as thiogalactosides, can function as inducers too.

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>The <i>trpLEDCBA</i> (trp) operon codes for the enzymes of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway. It is subject to several layers of regulation, including regulation of transcriptional initiation and ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation. <br>The expression of the <i>trp</i> operon is repressed 300-fold by TrpR. TrpR binds at the trpLp promoter, possibly directly blocking binding by RNA polymerase |CITS: [3050131]|. The genes within the <i>trp</i> operon also appear to be targeted for repression during anaerobiosis by the global regulator FNR, although it is still unknown which trp promoter (trpCp or trpLp) is affected and whether the effect is direct or indirect |CITS: [12754220]|. <br>WrbA initially appeared to influence the interaction betweenTrpR and the trp operator |CITS: [8516330]|. However, other research indicates that this is a nonspecific effect, with both WrbA and BSA generating an equivalent gel shift result |CITS: [9694845]|. <br>The Trp attenuator regulates transcription through the trp operon in response to the abundance of charged tRNA-Trp in the cell. When charged tRNA-Trp is abundant, mRNA transcription terminates within the leader sequence of the operon. Alternately, when charged tRNA-Trp is not abundant, transcription continues through the length of the operon |CITS: [4578102][4872441][4586412][340702][781269][781270][781271]|. The physical mechanism of transcriptional attenuation involves the close coupling of transcription and translation. In the case of the trp attenuator, the ribosome begins translating the leader peptide, TrpL, as RNA polymerase continues to transcribe the rest of the <i>trp</i> operon |CITS: [781274]|. This leader peptide contains a key pair of tryptophan codons. When charged tRNA-Trp is scarce, the ribosome stalls at these codons and RNA polymerase proceeds with transcription. Alternately, when charged tRNA-Trp is abundant, the ribosome quickly reads through these codons and RNA transcription terminates in the leader sequence |CITS: [6159477][366606]|. <br>Trp attenuation and the required close linking of translation and transcription all depend on the formation of alternate RNA secondary structures. When the ribosome proceeds quickly through the <i>trpL</i> leader sequence, a hairpin forms in the mRNA that acts as a transcriptional terminator. When the ribosome stalls due to lack of charged tRNA-Trp, an alternate RNA hairpin forms that prevents formation of the transcriptional terminator, allowing transcription of the RNA to continue |CITS: [781274][6159477][366606][118451][368800]|. The close coupling of transcription and translation is achieved through yet another RNA secondary structure. The <i>trpL</i> leader region has a third alternative hairpin that forms in the absence of the ribosome. This prevents formation of the antiterminator, in turn allowing the terminator to form and stall RNA polymerase. Thus, transcription cannot proceed unless the ribosome is present and charged tRNA-Trp is scarce |CITS: [2409288][6168281][2991886]|.<br>The <i>trpLEDCBA</i>, <i>aroH</i>, and <i>trpR</i> operons are coordinately regulated by the TrpR transcriptional repressor in response to intracellular levels of L-tryptophan (|CITS: [3315853]| and references therein).

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>The <i>tnaCAB</i> operon codes for two key enzymes in tryptophan metabolism, including tryptophanase. It is regulated by attenuation within its leader region in response to tryptophan abundance. When tryptophan is present, transcription continues through a Rho-dependent terminator and <i>tnaA</i> and <i>tnaB</i> are transcribed |CITS: [3902796]|. In addition, <i>tnaCAB</i> is also subject to regulation at the level of transcriptional initiation via CRP, although this is not the main regulatory control on the operon |CITS: [3902796]|. <br>Attenuation of <i>tnaCAB</i> occurs via ribosomal pausing at the tail end of the <i>tnaC</i> leader sequence. As translation of the leader peptide nears completion, it halts with the terminal proline of TnaC still attached to its tRNA and stuck within the ribosome. In the absence of tryptophan, peptide chain release factor RF1 and peptide chain release factor RF2 cleave TnaC from the tRNA and free the ribosome. This, in turn, allows access by Rho to a Rho-dependent terminator that then prematurely terminates transcription of <i>tnaCAB</i>. In the presence of tryptophan, release by RF1 and RF2 is prevented, and the ribosome remains in place, blocking access by Rho to the terminator and allowing continued transcription of the operon |CITS: [3902796][8682777][10869076][11050101][11470925][11880383]|. Eventually, the stalled ribosome is cleared away by ribosome recycling factor and peptide chain release factor RF3 |CITS: [17293419]|. As a natural consequence of this mechanism, attenuation at <i>tnaCAB</i> depends on both translation of the leader peptide and the presence of Rho |CITS: [7543478][8522534][2345136]|. <br>This close coupling of transcription and translation is achieved via an RNA polymerase-pausing mechanism. There is a pause site toward the latter end of the <i>tnaC</i> sequence. The RNA polymerase pauses there, allowing time for the ribosome to attach to the nascent RNA and begin translation. When the ribosome reaches the paused RNA polymerase, transcription continues. This pausing mechanism ensures that the ribosome is in the proper position to regulate the Rho-dependent terminator in response to tryptophan abundance |CITS: [14563884]|.<br>Rho-dependent termination within the <i>tnaC</i> sequence depends on both a <i>rut</i>- and a <i>boxA</i>-like sequence within the leader region of the operon |CITS: [10869076]|. The role of the <i>boxA</i>-like sequence in promoting termination is peculiar, as the actual <i>boxA</i> sequence normally acts as an antiterminator |CITS: [11880383]|.<br>Stalling of the ribosome during translation of TnaC depends on a complex interaction between the leader peptide and the ribosome. Attenuation is completely dependent on the sole tryptophan within the leader peptide sequence. Mutations at this position make tryptophan induction of <i>tnaCAB</i> impossible |CITS: [2345136]|. Specific residues within TnaC, most notably Asp-16 and Pro-24, are essential for inhibiting clearing of the TnaC-tRNA complex from the peptidyl transferase center within the ribosome and for altering the conformation of the 23S RNA in a manner that may help generate a tryptophan-binding site on the ribosome |CITS: [18424524]|.<br>Both YdgT and HolE appear to influence expression of <i>tnaA</i> by enhancing transcription termination at the leader DNA sequence |CITS: [24375106]|.<br>Based on work with mutant strains, it was determined that FNR, NarL, and NarP negatively regulate the <i>tnaCAB</i> operon in the exponential growth phase during anaerobic respiration of nitrate |CITS:[27631134]|.<br>ZraR represses <i>tnaAB</i> operon transcription.

It was not determined whether  the upstream gene (<i>cysD</i>) was part of the same operon, but the authors suggested that all the genes could be transcribed because their products are part of the same metabolic pathway.   In a more recent paper, <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Malo MS,1990</a>, a promoter upstream of <i>cysD</i> was described. In a third reference, <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Leyh TS,1992</a>, it is proposed that the three genes are translationally coupled, confirming that they reside within the same operon. Additionally, a terminator of transcription has also been identified.</TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE_WEB>

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>Computer analysis revealed one inverted repeat upstream of <i>nuoM</i> that  could form a stable stem-and-loop structure. It may serve as a signal of transcription regulation, causing RNA polymerase pausing. Each insertion used to construct a <i>nuo</i> mutant (<i>nuoB-C, nuoF, nuoG, nuoH, nuoI, nuoM</i>, and nuoN) exerted a polar effect upon dowstream transcription. With the exception of <i>nuoB</i>, this mutant synthesized detectable levels of the NuoCD subunit but did not synthesize any NuoG subunit. NuoG affects the promoter activity of this operon, although it is not known  whether the effect of NuoG on the promoter is a direct one.<br><br>The <i>nuo</i> operon is regulated by O<sub>2</sub> and nitrate via ArcA, NarL, FNR, and IHF. The main  effect  is an anaerobic repression by ArcA and nitrate stimulation by NarL.<br>Under nitrogen-rich growth conditions, the expression of the <i>nuoA</i> gene increased in a mutant for the transcriptional regulator Fnr. However, under nitrogen-limited growth conditions, the gene expression was decreased.  Under both nitrogen-limited and nitrogen-rich growth conditions, the expression of <i>nuoA</i> increased  in the mutants for <i>cyoA</i> and Fur.

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE_WEB>Computer analysis revealed one inverted repeat upstream of <i>nuoM</i> that  could form a stable stem-and-loop structure. It may serve as a signal of transcription regulation, causing RNA polymerase pausing. Each insertion used to construct a <i>nuo</i> mutant (<i>nuoB-C, nuoF, nuoG, nuoH, nuoI, nuoM</i>, and nuoN) exerted a polar effect upon dowstream transcription. With the exception of <i>nuoB</i>, this mutant synthesized detectable levels of the NuoCD subunit but did not synthesize any NuoG subunit. NuoG affects the promoter activity of this operon, although it is not known  whether the effect of NuoG on the promoter is a direct one.<br><br>The <i>nuo</i> operon is regulated by O<sub>2</sub> and nitrate via ArcA, NarL, FNR, and IHF. The main  effect  is an anaerobic repression by ArcA and nitrate stimulation by NarL.<br>Under nitrogen-rich growth conditions, the expression of the <i>nuoA</i> gene increased in a mutant for the transcriptional regulator Fnr. However, under nitrogen-limited growth conditions, the gene expression was decreased.  Under both nitrogen-limited and nitrogen-rich growth conditions, the expression of <i>nuoA</i> increased  in the mutants for <i>cyoA</i> and Fur.

However, the expression of individual <i>rpsU</i> and <i>rpoD</i> genes can be independently regulated by their own promoters.

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>The <i>pyrLBI</i> operon is regulated primarily by attenuation in response to pyrimidine availability. <br>The <i>pyrLBI</i> operon is controlled by an attenuator that responds to the abundance of UTP by a polymerase-pausing mechanism.  <i>pyrL</i>, the gene coding for the PyrL leader peptide, contains a transcriptional terminator preceded by a poly(T) sequence.  When UTP levels are low, transcriptional pausing occurs at this poly(T) sequence |CITS: [6300835]|.  More generally, this sequence leads to UTP-responsive transcriptional control, as transcription terminates there when UTP is abundant and proceeds when UTP levels are low, in a manner that depends on the presence of the terminator |CITS: [2991885]|.  The poly(T) tract is also absolutely required for transcriptional termination |CITS: [2656651]|. <br>The proposed model for the <i>pyrLBI</i> attenuator is that of polymerase pausing, in which the RNA polymerase may pause at the poly(T) sequence when UTP is lacking, giving the following ribosome a chance to catch up.  The proximity of the ribosome then prevents formation of the terminator and premature termination of transcription.  In contrast, when UTP is abundant the polymerase races ahead of the ribosome, allowing the terminator hairpin to form and terminating transcription.  Partial confirmation of this model comes from the fact that in strains with mutated, slow-moving ribosomes, <i>pyrLBI</i> transcription is far more effectively inhibited by UTP |CITS: [3044790]|. <br>In addition, although pyrimidine levels have little effect on translation of PyrL, translation of the leader peptide is required for proper regulation by attenuation.  Mutatations that block translation of PyrL disrupt attenuation at <i>pyrLBI</i> |CITS: [3928602]|.  Transcriptional pausing within <i>pyrL</i> is enhanced by NusA |CITS: [7517939]|.  In addition to attenuation, there is evidence of another transcription regulation mechanism, but its participating elements have not been identified |CITS: [2656651]|.<br>Based on DNA microarray analysis, the mechanism of bacterial inactivation by carvacrol and citral was studied |CITS: [28644990]|. Treatment by both compounds caused membrane damage and activated metabolism through the production of nucleotides required for DNA and RNA synthesis and metabolic processes |CITS: [28644990]|. A total of 76 and 156 genes demonstrated significant transcriptional differences by carvacrol and citral, respectively. Genes upregulated by carvacrol treatment included the multidrug efflux pump genes <i>acrA</i> and <i>mdtM</i>, genes related to the phage shock response, <i>pspA, pspB, pspC, pspD, pspF</i>, and <i>pspG</i>, and genes whose products are important for biosynthesis of arginine (<i>argC, argG, artJ<i>) and purine nucleotides (<i>purC, purM</i>). Genes upregulated by citral treatment included <i>purH</i>, <i>pyrB</i>, and <i>pyrI</i>. On the other hand, mutations in several differentially expressed genes confirmed the roles of <i>ygaV, yjbO, pspC, sdhA, yejG</i>, and <i>ygaV</i> in mechanisms of inactivation by carvacrol and citral |CITS: [28644990]|.</TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>The expression of genes for type 1 fimbriae (<i>fimAICDFGH</i>) is subject to a mode of regulatory control known as phase variation |CITS: [8878036]|.  In phase variation, individual cells switch between a state of expression (fimbriate) and nonexpression (afimbriate) and thereby produce a population of mixed cell types.  Phase variation of type 1 fimbriae in <i>Escherichia coli</i> is influenced by the orientation of the <i>fim</i> switch, <i>fimS</i>, a 314-bp invertible DNA element |CITS: [2863818]|.  Recombination of the <i>fim</i> switch requires the <i>fimB</i> and <i>fimE</i> gene products, considered to be the <i>fim</i> recombinases |CITS: [8878036]|.  Mutation deletion analyses of <i>fimB</i> and <i>fimE</i> mutants indicates that <i>fimB</i> is able to mediate recombination in both directions (on-to-off and off-to-on) while <i>fimE</i> only stimulates recombination in the on-to-off direction |CITS: [8101185]|.  Inversions of the <i>fim</i> switch at normal frequencies also requires the expression of <i>himA</i> and <i>himD</i>, which are the genes for the two subunits of integration host factor (IHF) |CITS: [2886490]|, <i>lrp</i>, the leucine-responsive regulatory protein |CITS: [7916011]|, and <i>hns</i>, the histone-like protein H1 |CITS: [1648076]|. Lrp recognizes and binds to three DNA-binding sites located within the fim switch, with central positions 204 (site 1), 235 (site 2), and 173 (site 3) bp from the transcriptional start site of the <i>fim</i> operon. The binding of Lrp to site 1 and site 2 favors the inversion process of the invertible region with a bias toward the &quot;on&quot; orientation, but when Lrp binds to site 3, the inversion is inhibited |CITS: [9515701]|. When leucine binds to Lrp, a dissociation of Lrp from site 3 is observed; thus, the inversion of the invertible DNA element is promoted by leucine |CITS: [9515701]|. In addition to the role that Lrp plays in the inversion process, it also seems to be required to keep the inversion trapped in the state of expression |CITS: [16855224]|.<br>By means of gene expression and mutation analysis, it was determined that the LrhA protein regulator regulates positively <i>fimE</i> expression, leading to the repression of the <i>fimA</i> operon through the on-off switch at <i>fimA</i> |CITS: [16207912]|.<br>The mRNA that contains the  <i>fimI</i> gene has been observed mainly in the cellular membrane |CITS: [31540875]|.<br></TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>

They investigated the interconnections and dynamics between Bae, Cpx, Psp, Rcs, and &sigma;<sup>E</sup> pathways and showed that these pathways can be activated simultaneously in response to exogenous or endogenous stimulation, while natural environmental stimuli provoke bacterial modifications that lead to multiple pathway responses <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Bury-Moné S, Nomane Y, Reymond N, Barbet R, Jacquet E, Imbeaud S, Jacq A, Bouloc P,2009</a> <br>Each of these responses might be specialized to ensure a specific aspect of envelope biogenesis and maintenance; on the other hand, CpxR could have a role as a modulator of the response by integrating other endogenous signals. Bury-Moré et al. concluded that all five pathways are needed to mount a full response to extracytoplasmic stress <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Bury-Moné S, Nomane Y, Reymond N, Barbet R, Jacquet E, Imbeaud S, Jacq A, Bouloc P,2009</a></TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE_WEB>

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>An integrated transcriptomic study of the extracytoplasmic stress response, which detects and responds to alterations of the bacterial envelope, was performed by Bury-Moré et al.

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>Gavigan et al. (1999) and Perini et al. (1996) showed that CytR binds in tandem in the regulated intergenic region |CITS:[10347150] [8969182]|. On the other hand, in 1997, Pedersen and Valentin-Hanses showed that CytR binds to octamer repeats, GTTGCATT in either the direct or inverted orientation and preferably separated by 2 or 3 bp |CITS: [9155036][9466254]|. For this reason the length of the CytR DNA-binding site is variable.<br>However, footprinting analyses showed that the dimers of CytR are flanked or sandwiched by two dimers of CRP |CITS:[20000490][1327747][9466254]|. Thus, the binding sites of CytR located in this region were assigned by the curator in agreement based on similarity to the consensus sequence and on the data from the footprinting assays and mutational evidence |CITS:[9466254][1327747][20000490][9155036][2170326][12391883]|.<br>The repressor CytR and the activator CRP, two dimeric proteins, interact to form a complex repressor nucleoprotein in the intergenic region. When only CRP is bound to this promoter, it functions as an activator, and then, when CytR binds to DNA and to CRP, the activation is repressed because CytR masks an activating region of CRP that otherwise would contact the RNA polymerase to activate transcription |CITS:[1327747][ 8736525][10766824]|. The CytR protein cannot act alone; the synergistic DNA binding is increased by direct interaction with CRP |CITS:[1327747][1962841][ 2170326][1649947]|.

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE_WEB>Gavigan et al. (1999) and Perini et al. (1996) showed that CytR binds in tandem in the regulated intergenic region <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Gavigan SA,1999. Perini LT,1996</a> On the other hand, in 1997, Pedersen and Valentin-Hanses showed that CytR binds to octamer repeats, GTTGCATT in either the direct or inverted orientation and preferably separated by 2 or 3 bp <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Pedersen H,1997. Jorgensen CI,1998</a>.

When only CRP is bound to this promoter, it functions as an activator, and then, when CytR binds to DNA and to CRP, the activation is repressed because CytR masks an activating region of CRP that otherwise would contact the RNA polymerase to activate transcription <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Holst B,1992.

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>PdhR was identified by Kaleta et al. (2010) as a negative regulator of <i>lipA</i>, based on consensus sequences, microarrays, and electromobility shift analyses (EMSA) at bp 69 (designated by Feng and Cronan [2014] as <i>lipA</i> site 1) of the <i>lipA</i>p promoter |CITS:[20718955]|. However, Feng and Cronan (2014) reported that this site is nonfunctional and physiologically irrelevant. The binding detected by Kaleta et al.

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>Based on DNA microarray analysis, the mechanism of bacterial inactivation by carvacrol and citral was studied |CITS: [28644990]|. Treatment by both compounds caused membrane damage and activated metabolism through the production of nucleotides required for DNA and RNA synthesis and metabolic processes |CITS: [28644990]|. A total of 76 and 156 genes demonstrated significant transcriptional differences by carvacrol and citral, respectively. Genes upregulated by carvacrol treatment included the multidrug efflux pump genes <i>acrA</i> and <i>mdtM</i>, genes related to the phage shock response, <i>pspA, pspB, pspC, pspD, pspF</i>, and <i>pspG</i>, and genes whose products are important for biosynthesis of arginine (<i>argC, argG, artJ<i>) and purine nucleotides (<i>purC, purM</i>). Genes upregulated by citral treatment included <i>purH</i>, <i>pyrB</i>, and <i>pyrI</i>. On the other hand, mutations in several differentially expressed genes confirmed the roles of <i>ygaV, yjbO, pspC, sdhA, yejG</i>, and <i>ygaV</i> in mechanisms of inactivation by carvacrol and citral |CITS: [28644990]|.</TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>Based on DNA microarray analysis, the mechanism of bacterial inactivation by carvacrol and citral was studied |CITS: [28644990]|. Treatment by both compounds caused membrane damage and activated metabolism through the production of nucleotides required for DNA and RNA synthesis and metabolic processes |CITS: [28644990]|. A total of 76 and 156 genes demonstrated significant transcriptional differences by carvacrol and citral, respectively. Genes upregulated by carvacrol treatment included the multidrug efflux pump genes <i>acrA</i> and <i>mdtM</i>, genes related to the phage shock response, <i>pspA, pspB, pspC, pspD, pspF</i>, and <i>pspG</i>, and genes whose products are important for biosynthesis of arginine (<i>argC, argG, artJ<i>) and purine nucleotides (<i>purC, purM</i>). Genes upregulated by citral treatment included <i>purH</i>, <i>pyrB</i>, and <i>pyrI</i>. On the other hand, mutations in several differentially expressed genes confirmed the roles of <i>ygaV, yjbO, pspC, sdhA, yejG</i>, and <i>ygaV</i> in mechanisms of inactivation by carvacrol and citral |CITS: [28644990]|.</TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE>The famine-feast cycle of bacterial growth was simulated by Horvath et al. (2010) by diluting stationary-phase cells in fresh medium containing galactose as the sole carbon source. The results showed, via measurements of the proper timing of gene expression in the galactose system, that the system has evolved to respond to environments where galactose levels are unpredictable and do not follow regular feast-famine cycles |CITS:[20923764]|.<br>Based on these results, a mathematical model was built where the intracellular D-galactose and cAMP-CRP levels were calculated |CITS:[20923764]|.<br>Rob is a transcriptional regulator related to the increase in resistance to antibiotics and is expressed constitutively. Bennik et al. have shown that this regulator represses  the transcription of the <i>galT</i> gene and that it forms multiple complexes in the promoter region, suggesting the existence of multiple Rob-binding sites |CITS: [ 10850996]|. <br>Based on the combination of the transcriptional network of the galactose regulon obtained from their experiments and data in the published literature, |CITS:[17630975]| constructed an integrated map of the galactose network.<br>The <i>galETKM</i> operon has six different mRNA species (mE1, mE2, mT1, mK1, mM1, and mK2) |CITS:[18374359][24794565]|.

		<TRANSCRIPTION_UNIT_NOTE_WEB>The famine-feast cycle of bacterial growth was simulated by Horvath et al. (2010) by diluting stationary-phase cells in fresh medium containing galactose as the sole carbon source. The results showed, via measurements of the proper timing of gene expression in the galactose system, that the system has evolved to respond to environments where galactose levels are unpredictable and do not follow regular feast-famine cycles <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Horváth P, Hunziker A, Erdossy J, Krishna S, Semsey S,2010</a><br>Based on these results, a mathematical model was built where the intracellular D-galactose and cAMP-CRP levels were calculated <a href="#myRef" class="linkBlue">Horváth P, Hunziker A, Erdossy J, Krishna S, Semsey S,2010</a><br>Rob is a transcriptional regulator related to the increase in resistance to antibiotics and is expressed constitutively.
